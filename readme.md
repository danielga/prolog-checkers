Prolog Checkers
===============

A portuguese checkers game in Prolog (with a crappy Java GUI).

Only missing features are more advanced rules like priority of piece eating (should eat queens/kings first).

Prolog:
Code is in the prolog folder.
Execute main.pl and call startX to play first with crosses or startO to play after the computer and with circles.
A move is of the type StartLine/StartColumn-DestinationLine/DestinationColumn. Don't forget the period to do the move!

Java:
Use checkers.jar to play. Needs the images and prolog folders in the same place as the jar.
Otherwise, this is an Eclipse project and contains everything needed to compile.
